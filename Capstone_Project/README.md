# 🚀 Capstone Project: Space Salvage

Welcome to the final test. You are no longer just following lessons; you are building a product.

## The Mission
Build a playable "Space Salvage" game using only the knowledge from Modules 01-04. You must handle movement, collisions, and state management without guided tutorials.

## Mandatory Features
1. **Game Loop**: Locked at 60 FPS.
2. **Keyboard Input**: 8-way movement with momentum.
3. **Sprites**: Use `player.png` and `enemy.png`.
4. **Collision Detection**: Pixel-perfect or Rect-based interaction.
5. **System**: A hull integrity (health) and scoring system.
6. **Game States**: A clear "Game Over" screen with a restart option.

## Constraints
- **Do NOT copy-paste** code from previous modules unless you can explain every line.
- **Do NOT use external libraries** beyond Pygame and standard Python modules.
- **Strict Naming**: Follow the rules in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Extra Credit
- Implement a "High Score" system that saves to a file.
- Add "Juice": Screen shake on impact or particle effects for salvage.

**Begin your journey in [starter_code.py](./starter_code.py)**.
