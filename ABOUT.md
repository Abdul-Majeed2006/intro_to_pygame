# 🖋️ About the Pygame Masterclass

## The Philosophy
Most tutorials teach you how to "make a game." This curriculum teaches you how to **become a games engineer.** We value clean architecture, deterministic logic, and object-oriented principles over "cool graphics."

## Who is this for?
- **Python Learners**: Who have finished a "basics" course and want to apply logic to a real-time system.
- **Aspiring Devs**: Who want to understand engine architecture from the ground up.
- **The Disciplined**: Those who aren't looking for a shortcut.

## Who is this NOT for?
- **Shortcut Seekers**: If you want a "Game in 5 Minutes," this is the wrong repo.
- **No-Coders**: This is a code-first, logic-heavy track.

## How this differs
We do not use global variables. We do not use "magic numbers." We do not teach "beginner shortcuts" that you'll have to unlearn later. We teach production standards from Chapter 01.
