# 🎮 Zero to Hero: Pygame Masterclass

## Build Professional Games, Not Just Scripts

**Zero to Hero: Pygame Masterclass** is the definitive project-based curriculum for developers ready to stop following "hello world" tutorials and start building scalable, professional-grade games. This repository takes you from a blank screen to mastering core game engine architecture.

### 🎯 Who is this for?

- **Python Beginners** wanting a fun, visual way to master the language.
- **Aspiring Game Devs** looking for professional architecture patterns (OOP, Managers).
- **Computer Science Students** wanting to apply Geometry and Math to real-time systems.

### 🗺️ The Roadmap

#### Phase 1: The Fundamentals (Brutal 2D Focus)

Master the core engine patterns before touching anything advanced.

1. **[01. Basics](./01_Basics/)**
   Master the Game Loop, Window Management, and the fundamental coordinate system used by the pros.
2. **[02. Events and Input](./02_Events_And_Input/)**
   Bridge the hardware gap with comprehensive support for Keyboard, Mouse, and **Gamepad/Controller** input.
3. **[03. Sprites and Collisions](./03_Sprites_And_Collisions/)**
   Level up with professional Class-based organization and efficient hit detection for entities.
4. **[04. UI and Sounds](./04_UI_And_Sounds/)**
   Add "The Juice" using centralized Sound Managers and reactive User Interfaces (Buttons & Fonts).

#### Phase 2: Advanced Track (Optional)

Once you've mastered the basics, venture into specialized domains.

- **[Networking](./Advanced_Archive/networking/)**
  Multiplayer architecture, Sockets, and Threading for real-time synchronization.
