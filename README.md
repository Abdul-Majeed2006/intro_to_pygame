# 🎮 Zero to Hero: Pygame Masterclass

Welcome to the ultimate **Game Development Curriculum** for Python. 
This is not just a tutorial; it is a **Project-Based Learning Environment** that takes you from writing your first line of code to exporting a professional game to Android and the Web.

## 📂 The Self-Contained Curriculum
All learning materials are located in the `Notes/` folder. They are numbered 1 through 17.
You can delete everything else in this folder (including `Final_project`) and these notes will still work perfectly.
