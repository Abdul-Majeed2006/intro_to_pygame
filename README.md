# 🎮 Zero to Hero: Pygame Masterclass

## Build Professional Games, Not Just Scripts

**Zero to Hero: Pygame Masterclass** is the definitive project-based curriculum for developers ready to stop following "hello world" tutorials and start building scalable, professional-grade games. This repository takes you from a blank screen to mastering core game engine architecture.

### 🎯 Who is this for?

- **Python Beginners** wanting a fun, visual way to master the language.
- **Aspiring Game Devs** looking for professional architecture patterns (OOP, Managers).
- **Computer Science Students** wanting to apply Geometry and Math to real-time systems.

### 🚀 Get Started (3-Step Onboarding)

#### 1. Verify Your Environment

Before starting, ensure you have Python installed. Open your terminal/command prompt and type:

```bash
python --version
```

*Expected: Python 3.8 or higher.*

#### 2. Install the Engine

Run this command to install the Pygame library, which handles our graphics and sound:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

### 🗺️ The Learning Path

#### Phase 1: The Project-Self-Contained Fundamentals

Each folder is a complete lesson including **Theory**, **Example Code**, **Local Assets**, and a **Challenge**.

1. **[01. Basics](./01_Basics/)**
   Master the Game Loop, Window Management, and the coordinate system used by professional engines.
2. **[02. Events and Input](./02_Events_And_Input/)**
   Learn how to handle Keyboard, Mouse, and **Gamepad/Controller** input for a responsive feel.
3. **[03. Sprites and Collisions](./03_Sprites_And_Collisions/)**
   Move beyond basic shapes to professional Sprite-based architecture and efficient collision logic.
4. **[04. UI and Sounds](./04_UI_And_Sounds/)**
   Add "The Juice" with dynamic Sound Managers and reactive User Interfaces (Buttons & Text).

#### Phase 2: Advanced Labs (For Later)

Exploration into specialized game dev domains once you've cleared Phase 1.

- **[Networking](./Advanced_Archive/networking/)**
  Multiplayer architecture, Sockets, and Threading for real-time synchronization.
- **[More Resources](./Advanced_Archive/Resource_Bank/)**
  A bank of 100+ organized game assets for your future projects.
