# PyGame Fundamentals: An Engineering-First Curriculum

**Master the engineering foundations of 2D game development by architecting professional-grade systems from scratch.**

## Focus & Discipline
This curriculum is a transition from writing Python scripts to architecting game engines. It eliminates common beginner shortcuts and teaches industry-standard patterns like Object-Oriented Sprites, State Machines, and Deterministic Loops.

## Audience & Exclusions
- **Target**: Python learners who want to understand real-time system architecture.
- **Excluded**: Learners seeking "quick games," copy-pasted solutions, or shallow tutorials.

## Curriculum Outcome
You will build **Space Salvage**—a complete entity-management project featuring:
- Custom Sprite-based management systems.
- Robust collision resolution.
- Dynamic game-state and audio management.

## Learning Path
- **[01. The Basics](./01_Basics/)**: Deterministic Game Loops and timing.
- **[02. Events & Input](./02_Events_And_Input/)**: Professional handling vs. polling.
- **[03. Sprites & Collisions](./03_Sprites_And_Collisions/)**: OOP architecture and rectangle physics.
- **[04. UI & Sound](./04_UI_And_Sounds/)**: State machines and feedback systems.
- **[Capstone Project](./Capstone_Project/)**: The final engineering evaluation.
