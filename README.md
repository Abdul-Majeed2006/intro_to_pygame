# 🎮 Zero to Hero: Pygame Masterclass

**Master the engineering fundamentals of 2D game development by building professional-grade systems from scratch.**

## 🎯 The Promise
Transition from writing Python scripts to architecting game engines. This curriculum eliminates "beginner shortcuts" and teaches industry-standard patterns like Object-Oriented Sprites, State Machines, and Deterministic Loops.

## 👤 Is This For You?
- **YES**: You know Python basics and want to learn real-time system architecture.
- **YES**: You want to understand *how* engines work before using Unity or Godot.
- **NO**: You want a "game in 5 minutes" or copy-paste tutorials.

## 🏗️ What You Will Build
You will progress through four rigorous modules to build **Space Salvage**—a complete, momentum-based project featuring:
- Custom Sprite-based entity management.
- Robust collision resolution.
- Dynamic UI and audio state management.

## 📂 The Learning Path
1. **[01. The Basics](./01_Basics/)**: Mastery of the Game Loop and timing.
2. **[02. Events & Input](./02_Events_And_Input/)**: Professional handling vs. polling.
3. **[03. Sprites & Collisions](./03_Sprites_And_Collisions/)**: OOP architecture and rectangle physics.
4. **[04. UI & Sound](./04_UI_And_Sounds/)**: State machines and meaningful feedback.
5. **[Capstone Project](./Capstone_Project/)**: The final engineering test.

## 🚀 Start Here
1. **Read the [About](./ABOUT.md)** section to understand the philosophy.
2. **Review the [Quality Bar](./QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md)** for coding standards.
3. **Begin [Lesson 01](./01_Basics/lesson.md)**.
