# 🎮 Zero to Hero: Pygame Masterclass

**Master the engineering fundamentals of 2D game development by building professional-grade systems from day one.**

## 🎯 The Value Prop
This is not a "follow-along" tutorial. It is a rigorous curriculum designed to transition Python beginners into Game Engineers who can architect, optimize, and deploy standalone 2D products.

- **Audience**: Python beginners who want to build games, not scripts.
- **Outcomes**: Complete a momentum-based space game and master OOP-based game architecture.
- **Duration**: ~10-15 hours of focused engineering.

## 🚀 Start Here
1. **Verify Requirements**: Python 3.10+ is strictly required.
2. **Follow the [Learning Path](./LEARNING_PATH.md)**: Do not skip modules.
3. **Track Your Progress**: Use [PROGRESS.md](./PROGRESS.md) to stay on target.

## 🏗️ Beyond the Basics
Once you clear the **[Capstone Project](./Capstone_Project/)**, you unlock:
- **[Advanced Engineering Roadmap](./ADVANCED_ROADMAP.md)**
- **[Advanced Labs](./advanced/)** (Architecture, Performance, Networking)

## ⚖️ Engineering Judgment
Before you start, read **[Why Pygame?](./WHY_PYGAME.md)** to understand the tradeoffs of this library and when to graduate to engines like Unity or Godot.
