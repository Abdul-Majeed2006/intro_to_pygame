# 🎮 Zero to Hero: Pygame Masterclass

Welcome to the ultimate **Game Development Curriculum** for Python. 
This is not just a tutorial; it is a **Project-Based Learning Environment** that takes you from writing your first line of code to exporting a professional game to Android and the Web.

## 📂 The Self-Contained Curriculum
All learning materials are located in the `Notes/` folder. They are numbered 1 through 17.
You can delete everything else in this folder (including `Final_project`) and these notes will still work perfectly.

### Phase 1: Foundations (The Engine) 🔧
*   **[Chapter 1: Setup & Basics](./Notes/Chapter_1_Setup_and_Basics.ipynb)**: The Game Loop, Window Management, and Frame Rate.
*   **[Chapter 2: Drawing & Graphics](./Notes/Chapter_2_Drawing_and_Images.ipynb)**: Loading Assets, Blitting, and the Coordinate System.
*   **[Chapter 3: Inputs & Events](./Notes/Chapter_3_Inputs_and_Events.ipynb)**: Keyboard, Mouse, and **Gamepad/Controller** support.
*   **[Chapter 4: Sprites & Classes](./Notes/Chapter_4_Sprites_and_Classes.ipynb)**: Object Oriented Programming (OOP) for Games.
