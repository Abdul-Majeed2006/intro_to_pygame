# ⌨️ Anti-Copy Policy: Typing is Thinking

In this curriculum, the code provided in `examples.py` is for reference and analysis. The exercises and the Capstone Project are meant to be **typed from scratch.**

## 🛑 The Rule
**Do not copy-paste code snippets into your exercise files.**

## 🧠 Why Copying Kills Learning
1. **Muscle Memory**: Typing forces your brain to process syntax, indentation, and structure.
2. **Error Encounter**: When you type and fail, you learn how to debug. When you copy and succeed, you learn nothing.
3. **Visual Parsing**: Manually transcribing code trains your eyes to spot the difference between `=` (assignment) and `==` (comparison).

## ✅ The Proper Flow
1. **Read** the lesson and the example.
2. **Close** the example file.
3. **Type** your solution in the exercise file.
4. **Debug** your own typos without looking back unless you are truly stuck.

We are building engineers, not script-kiddies. Respect the process.
