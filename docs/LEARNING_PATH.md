# 🗺️ Learning Path: Intro to Pygame

This is your roadmap to mastering the fundamentals of 2D game development. By the end of this path, you will be able to build structured, event-driven applications with graphics and sound.

## 🛤️ The Core Track (Must Follow in Order)

1. **[01. The Basics](./01_Basics/)**: Master the Game Loop, Windowing, and FPS.
2. **[02. Events & Input](./02_Events_And_Input/)**: Distinguish between discrete events and continuous polling.
3. **[03. Sprites & Collisions](./03_Sprites_And_Collisions/)**: Transition to OOP and Rect-based physics.
4. **[04. UI & Sound](./04_UI_And_Sounds/)**: Add "The Juice" and basic State Management.
5. **[Capstone: Space Salvage](./Capstone_Project/)**: Integrate all skills into a standalone game.

## 🎓 What You Will Earn
- The ability to architect a game without "global spaghetti."
- Mastery over the `Rectangle` (the most powerful tool in 2D dev).
- A foundation solid enough to move into `pygame_advanced_systems`.

## 🔒 Prerequisites
- Basic Python knowledge (Functions, Classes, If/Else).
- Python 3.10 or higher.

## 🚫 What is NOT Taught Here
- High-level 3D math.
- Networking/Multiplayer (covered in the Advanced sister repo).
- Shaders/GLSL (covered in the Advanced sister repo).
