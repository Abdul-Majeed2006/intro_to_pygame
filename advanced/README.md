# ⚡ Advanced Engineering Track

**WARNING**: This directory contains advanced system engineering concepts. It is strictly not beginner-friendly. 

## 🛑 Prerequisites
Do not attempt these modules unless you have completed the [Capstone Project](../Capstone_Project/) and passed all checks in [PROGRESS.md](../PROGRESS.md).

## 🎯 Learning Scope
In this track, we move away from "making games" and focus on **building engines**.
- **Architecture**: Decoupled input, Scene Management, and Component-based design.
- **Performance**: Bitmask collisions, Dirty Rectangles, and CPU profiling.
- **Networking**: Socket programming, Latency compensation, and State Sync.
- **Experiments**: Shaders (GLSL) and non-core Pygame integrations.

## 📜 Standards
The code in these folders may be experimental. However, any contribution must still adhere to the fundamental **[Quality Bar](../QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md)**.
