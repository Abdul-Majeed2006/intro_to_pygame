# ⚡ Advanced Pygame Roadmap: The Engineering Frontier

> "Beginners build features. Engineers build systems."

The core curriculum (01-04) teaches you how to use Pygame. This repository is your **Beginner → Intermediate Masterclass**. To keep your learning focused, all high-level engineering systems will live in our future dedicated sister repository: `pygame_advanced_systems`.

## 🛑 Prerequisites for Graduation

You are ready to leave this repository and move to advanced systems only when you have:

1. Mastered the **Game Loop** (01).
2. Solved **Diagonal Speed Normalization** (02 Exercise).
3. Implemented a **Sprite-based Collision Group** (03).
4. Created a **Reactive UI with Audio Feedback** (04).
5. Built and deployed the **Space Salvage Capstone**.

## 🏗️ The Next Horizon (pygame_advanced_systems)

The following modules are currently in development for the separate advanced repository. These represent the transition from "Game Maker" to "Engine Architect."

### Module 06: Architecture & State Machines

- **The Concept**: Move away from monolithic `while True` loops.
- **Payoff**: A game that can scale to thousands of lines without breaking.

### Module 07: Performance & Optimization

- **The Concept**: Frame-rate independence and pixel-efficiency.
- **Payoff**: 60 FPS even on low-end hardware with hundreds of active entities.

### Module 08: Networking Concepts

- **The Concept**: The nightmare of latency and synchronization.
- **Payoff**: Your first "Hello World" over a local network.

### Module 09: Shader Experiments (Visual Excellence)

- **The Concept**: Beyond the CPU. Marked as "Non-Pygame Core".

## 🏛️ The Legacy Archive

Materials stored in the [Advanced Archive](./Advanced_Archive/) are legacy experiments only. They serve as historical reference but do not meet our current [Professional Standards](./CONTRIBUTING.md). Once the new repository is live, these will be retired.
