# 🛠️ Module 01 Exercise: Textured Environments

## Goal: Transform a blank screen into a textured environment.

### 📝 Instructions

1. Open [examples.py](./examples.py).
2. Inside the drawing section, implement a **Nested Loop** that tiles the entire screen with the `sand_tile_image`.
3. **Bonus**: Change the `TARGET_FPS` to `10` and then `120`. Observe how the "smoothness" of the window changes.

## 💡 Hint
Get the image size with `sand_tile_image.get_width()` and loop through the `SCREEN_WIDTH` and `SCREEN_HEIGHT`.

**Check your progress**: Once you can see a full desert floor, you've ready for Module 02.
