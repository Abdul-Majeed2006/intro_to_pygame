# Progression Tracker

Use this file to track your journey from "Script Writer" to "Game Engineer". Check off tasks only when you have completed the module's exercise without looking at the solution code.

## 🟢 Phase 1: Fundamentals
- [ ] **01. The Basics**: I can manage a 60 FPS loop and draw static surfaces.
- [ ] **02. Events & Input**: I understand the difference between a key-down event and hardware polling.
- [ ] **03. Sprites & Collisions**: I am comfortable with OOP inheritance and Rect-based clamping.
- [ ] **04. UI & Sound**: I can implement basic state machines and handle audio feedback.

## 🏆 The Graduation: Capstone
- [ ] **Requirements Met**: Every mandatory feature in `requirements.md` is functional.
- [ ] **Code Audit Pass**: No global variables. Proper function scoping used throughout.
- [ ] **[Space Salvage Complete]**: I have a playable game I am proud to show.

## 🎓 Advanced Readiness
**You are ready for the Advanced track if:**
1. You finished the Capstone without significant external help.
2. You understand *why* global variables are a liability in game dev.
3. You can explain the "Double Buffering" concept clearly.
