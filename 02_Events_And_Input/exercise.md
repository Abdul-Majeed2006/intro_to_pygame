# 🛠️ Module 02 Exercise: The Sprint Mechanic

## Goal: Implement a "Sprint" mechanic.

### 📝 Instructions

1. Open [examples.py](./examples.py).
2. Create a variable `player_speed = 5`.
3. Check if `pygame.K_LSHIFT` is being held down using state polling.
4. If it is, set `player_speed = 10`. Otherwise, keep it at `5`.
5. Use this `player_speed` variable to change how the white circle moves in your console logs or on-screen.

**Check your progress**: If you can "sprint" by holding Shift, you've mastered state polling!
